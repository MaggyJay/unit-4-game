Information
-------------
I wanted to create a simple RPG game. I decided to choose a game I played as a kid, Final Fantasy VII. The most difficult part I came across were the initial beginning steps. It was hard outlining how the program should be outlined. Most of my time was spent researching out to get the page to update and hold the values related to the character information. My main challenge was figuring out syntax errors such as my properties within my objects being undefined. 

The game was created with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. 

For my approach in design I wanted it to be reminicsent of earlier basic 90 static RPG's and I wanted the color scheme to closely resemble the original 1997 FFVII game.
